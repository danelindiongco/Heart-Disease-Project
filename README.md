Heart disease is the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. This project aims to produce a classification model, using machine learning, to detect individuals with heart disease early.
The classification model is trained using a dataset with 11 features that can be used to predict the possibility of an individual with heart disease. The dataset can be found here:
